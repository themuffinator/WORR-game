# Reference materials

This directory collects upstream archives, historical patches, and assorted notes that inform WORR development.

- `quake2-rerelease-dll-main/`, `Quake-III-Arena-master/`, and `Quake-III-Arena-master.zip` retain upstream source drops for comparison.
- `ft-changes/`, `ionized-changes/`, and `psx-changes/` track patch sets pulled from related mods.
- `_old/` holds legacy experimental code kept for posterity.
- `entities.def`, `includes*.txt`, `maps-to-remake.txt`, `progress.txt`, and `regex-non-ascii-char.txt` are working notes generated by tooling or manual audits.
- `g_cmds.cpp` and `g_cmds_voting.cpp` provide archived snapshots of the original command implementations for reference.

Keep automation, scripts, and other executable tooling under `tools/`. When additional reference material is needed, prefer dropping it here rather than in the tooling directory.
