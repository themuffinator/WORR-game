// This file contains the core Artificial Intelligence (AI) logic for monsters.
// It provides the fundamental building blocks for monster behavior, which are
// then used by individual monster implementations.
//
// Key Responsibilities:
// - Basic AI States: Implements the functions for core monster states like
//   standing (`ai_stand`), walking (`ai_walk`), running/charging (`ai_run`),
//   and turning (`ai_turn`).
// - Target Acquisition: Manages the logic for how monsters find and react to
//   targets (`FindTarget`, `FoundTarget`), including sight checks, sound
//   detection, and reacting to being damaged.
// - Attack Logic: Contains the primary function (`ai_checkattack`) that
//   monsters call to decide whether they should perform a melee or ranged
//   attack, or continue moving.
// - Sensory Functions: Provides utility functions for visibility (`visible`),
//   field of view (`infront`), and distance checking (`range_to`).
