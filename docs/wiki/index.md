## Project Scope

WORR is an advanced gameplay expansion and server mod for the **QUAKE II Rerelease**. It builds on the rerelease to deliver a richer, more dynamic single-player and multiplayer experience. Extensive refinements and bug fixes span the campaign and multiplayer modes, with vastly expanded support for entities, monsters, and map logic that pull in elements from other QUAKE titles and popular community mods. Gameplay is tuned for both veterans seeking greater challenge and newcomers who benefit from improved accessibility.

## Goals at a Glance

- **Elevate the QUAKE II Rerelease** with expanded entities, smarter AI, and refined balance that respect the original feel while raising the skill ceiling.
- **Empower organized play** through match presets, tournament orchestration, and recovery tooling that keep sessions fair and resilient.
- **Streamline collaboration** across players, server hosts, level designers, and programmers by documenting conventions, workflows, and extension points.
