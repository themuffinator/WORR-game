// g_turret.cpp (Game Turret Logic)
// This file contains the logic for all turret-based entities in the game.
// It manages the behavior of the turret driver (the AI brain), the base, and
// the breach (the firing mechanism), allowing them to work together as a
// cohesive unit.
//
// Key Responsibilities:
// - Turret AI: Implements the `turret_driver_think` function, which handles
//   target acquisition, aiming, and firing decisions for the turret.
// - Movement and Rotation: The `turret_breach_think` function controls the
//   physical rotation of the turret barrel to track targets.
// - Blocking and Damage: Defines how turrets react when their movement is
//   blocked by another entity.
// - Activation: Handles the logic for turrets that are spawned inactive and
//   must be triggered by another entity before they begin operating.
