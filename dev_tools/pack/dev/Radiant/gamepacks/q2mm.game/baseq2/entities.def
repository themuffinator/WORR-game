speed	default 150

Plats are always drawn in the extended position, so they will light correctly.

If the plat is the target of another trigger or button, it will start out disabled in the extended position until it is triggered, when it will lower and become a normal plat.

"speed"	overrides default 200.
"accel" overrides default 500
"lip"	overrides default 8 pixel lip

If the "height" key is set, that will determine the amount the plat moves, instead of being implicitly determined by the model's height.

Set "sounds" to one of the following:
1) base fast
2) chain slow

/*QUAKED target_poi (1 0 0) (-4 -4 -4) (4 4 4) NEAREST DUMMY DYNAMIC x x x x x NOT_EASY NOT_MEDIUM NOT_HARD NOT_DM NOT_COOP
[Paril-KEX] point of interest for help in player navigation.
Without any additional setup, targeting this entity will switch
the current POI in the level to the one this is linked to.

"count": if set, this value is the 'stage' linked to this POI. A POI
with this set that is activated will only take effect if the current
level's stage value is <= this value, and if it is, will also set
the current level's stage value to this value.

"style": only used for teamed POIs; the POI with the lowest style will
be activated when checking for which POI to activate. This is mainly
useful during development, to easily insert or change the order of teamed
POIs without needing to manually move the entity definitions around.

"team": if set, this will create a team of POIs. Teamed POIs act like
a single unit; activating any of them will do the same thing. When activated,
it will filter through all of the POIs on the team selecting the one that
best fits the current situation. This includes checking "count" and "style"
values. You can also set the NEAREST spawnflag on any of the teamed POIs,
which will additionally cause activation to prefer the nearest one to the player.
Killing a POI via killtarget will remove it from the chain, allowing you to
adjust valid POIs at runtime.

The DUMMY spawnflag is to allow you to use a single POI as a team member
that can be activated, if you're using killtargets to remove POIs.

The DYNAMIC spawnflag is for very specific circumstances where you want
to direct the player to the nearest teamed POI, but want the path to pick
the nearest at any given time rather than only when activated.

The DISABLED flag is mainly intended to work with DYNAMIC & teams; the POI
will be disabled until it is targeted, and afterwards will be enabled until
it is killed.
